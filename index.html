                <p>Octopuses are carnivorous invertebrates that primarily feed on other ocean creatures. </p>
                <p>Octopuses are opportunistic predators, meaning they eat whatever is available in their surroundings.
                </p>
                <p>They use their eight arms, which are equipped with suction cups, to capture their prey. The arms then
                    bring the food to the octopus’s bulbous head, where a sharp beak is used to break down the prey’s
                    hard shell or exoskeleton.</p>

            <p>Their diet varies depending on their habitat, size, and species of octopuses.</p>
            <p>Some of the common prey of octopuses include crabs, clams, snails, shrimp, and small fish.</p>
            <p>The giant Pacific octopus, which is the largest octopus species, can even eat small sharks and birds. The
                common octopus, on the other hand, feeds on crustaceans and small mollusks.</p>
            <p>Octopuses require a diet rich in nutrients to maintain their health. They have three hearts and a high
                metabolism, which means they need a lot of oxygen and food to survive.</p>

            <p>Being aware of your pet’s species will assist you in keeping the appropriate tank water temperature and
                nutrition for your pet. It also provides you with an estimate of the tank size requirement necessary for
                your pet. </p>
            <p>Here are some tank requirements that can be followed to successfully keep pet octopus in the aquarium:

                salinity between 1.022 – 1.023,
                pH value of 8.2 with lots of oxygen,
                temperature around 76 – 78 degrees Fahrenheit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Octopuses are generally delicate to keep in a captive enclosure and therefore require a safe and
                pristine environment to survive. It is therefore imperative for the keeper to ensure water quality at
                all times.
